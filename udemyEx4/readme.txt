1. Challenge

You have been approached as an analytics consultant by a movie reviews website. 
They are writing up an article analysing movie ratings by critics and audience as well as movie budgets for the years 2007-2011.

This is the first time they are doing this analysis and they don’t know exactly what they need. 
They have asked you to look into the data and provide them with 5 graphs that tell a story about the data.

However, there is one chart the CEO specifically requested - a diagram showing how the correlation between audience and critic ratings has evolved throughout the years by genre. 
This is in addition to the other 5.

2. Homework

The movie reviews website was very happy with your deliverable for the previous assignment and now they have a new request for you.

The previous consultant had created a chart for them which is illustrated in the image in the this folder. However, the R code used to create the diagram has since been lost and cannot
be recovered. Your task is to come up with the code that will re-create the same chart making it look as close as possible to the original.

A new dataset has been supplied.
