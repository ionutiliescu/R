1. Challenges

You are employed as a Data Scientist by the World Bank and you are working on a project to analyse the World’s demographic trends.

You are required to produce a scatterplot illustrating Birth Rate and Internet Usage statistics by Country.

The scatterplot needs to also be categorised by Countries’ Income Groups. 


You have received an urgent update from your manager.

You are required to produce a second scatterplot also illustrating Birth Rate and Internet Usage statistics by Country.

However, this time the scatterplot needs to be categorised by Countries’ Regions. Additional data has been supplied in the form of R vectors.


2. Homework

You are required to produce a scatterplot depicting Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis) statistics by Country.

The scatterplot needs to also be categorised by Countries’ Regions.

You have been supplied with data for 2 years: 1960 and 2013 and you are required to produce a visualisation for each of these years.

Some data has been provided in a csv file, some - in R vectors. The csv file contains combined data for both years. 
All data manipulations have to be performed in R (not in excel) because this project may be audited at a later stage.
